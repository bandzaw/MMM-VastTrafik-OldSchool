# MMM-VastTrafik-OldSchool
This is a MagicMirror module that shows VÃ¤sttrafik's departure times for all lines at desired bus/tram stop. I've been using the old wap API in decades(!) and will do so until it stops working I guess... This old wap API has been more stable than the other fancy new APIs that breaks small but useful utilities like this with every new API version, which is a real pity.
