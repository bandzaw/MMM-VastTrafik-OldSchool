# MMM-VastTrafik-OldSchool
This is a MagicMirror module that shows VÃ¤sttrafik's departure times for all lines at desired bus/tram stop. I've been using the old wap API in decades(!) and will do so until it stops working I guess... (It's been more stable than the other fancy new APIs breaking utilities like these, which is a real pity.
